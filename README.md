# Graph-problem-using-Euler-s-Tree-Technique

This program is used to solve the path query problem of tree in an efficient manner . In this code we are using Euler's tree technique also called as Tree flattening technique for handling the subqueries and also used Mo's algorithm to sort the queries in an efficient manner . We also used binary lifting technique to compute lowest common ancestor of two nodes in log(n) time .
So the problem is that we are given a tree with each node having some value with it and given 'm' queries in which we are given three integers 'a , b , c' and we have to find that if there is any node with valur 'c' between the path of node 'a' and 'b'.
If the node is present is present we have to print "Find" otherwise we have to print "NotFind".
